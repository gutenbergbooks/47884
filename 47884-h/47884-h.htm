of the United States were covered with
deeply wooded virgin forests frequented
only by denizens of the wildwood, the
Pileated Woodpecker was an abundant
resident through nearly all of North
America. A bird citizen of the deeper
and more extensive forest regions, it has
gradually retreated before the advance of
man, and it is a very rare visitant in the
Eastern States and is only found in the
thickly settled and heavily timbered bottom
lands which the human intruder
seldom penetrates. In the Southern
States it is more common and may be
considered abundant in some sections.</p>
<p>Mr. Manly Hardy says: &ldquo;The Pileated
Woodpecker is a constant resident
of Maine, but rarely leaves the vicinity
of large timber. It prefers places where
large hemlocks abound, especially those
localities where a few have been killed
by camp building or small fires.&rdquo; A
strange feature of its distribution is that,
though it is distributed quite generally
throughout North America, there are
many heavily timbered areas, well suited
to its habits, in which it is not found. If
it occurs at all it is very rare in the
Southern Rocky Mountain regions, and
is also rare in Alaska.</p>
<p>The Pileated Woodpecker is a beautiful
bird of great size and strength. Its
bill is both large and powerful. In fact,
it is exceeded in size by but one of the
Woodpeckers&mdash;the ivory-billed species&mdash;which
is a resident of the Southern
States. It is quite variable in its habits.
In some sections it is very shy and retiring,
while in others it is quite tame and
becomes quite accustomed to man if not
ruthlessly annoyed. Mr. Hardy, writing
of his experience with this bird in the
woods of Maine, says: &ldquo;I once had two
so tame they would allow me to sit within
four paces of them, and put my hand
upon the tree when they were not ten
feet above my head.&rdquo; Mr. Chapman,
writing of its habits in the cypress
swamps of Florida, says: &ldquo;There, contrary
to the experience of Audubon, I
found it by no means a wild bird. Indeed,
flickers were more difficult to approach,&rdquo;
and he also writes: &ldquo;I have
called these birds to me by simply clapping
my slightly closed palms, making a
sound in imitation of their tapping on
a resonant limb.&rdquo; Another writer states
that when called in this manner, &ldquo;they
seem to lose their usual shyness and seem
stupefied at not finding their mate, as
they had expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few birds are more useful in the
preservation of the forest from destruction
by insect pests. &ldquo;A workman is
known by his chips.&rdquo; The energy and
perseverance of the Pileated Woodpecker,
as it seeks for the destructive borers or
other injurious insects, in the bark and
wood of afflicted trees, is amply attested
by numerous denuded trees and by the
strips of bark and piles of chips lying on
the ground. The hammering of the more
familiar species of woodpeckers is but a
light tapping when compared with the
loud and resounding whacks of its powerful
strokes. It has been known to &ldquo;chisel
holes six or eight inches deep in cedar
and other soft-wood trees, and as large
as the holes in a post-and-rail fence,&rdquo;
and to &ldquo;pick a large hole through two
inches of frozen green hemlock to get at
the hollow interior.&rdquo; It seldom, if ever,
attacks healthy trees and it is a constant
resident of extensive forests that have
been swept by destructive fires and the
bare tree trunks left to decay.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Mr. Wilson, that enthusiastic student
of bird life, writes in his usual interesting
manner concerning the habits of the Pileated
Woodpecker. In his &ldquo;American
Ornithology&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;Almost every old
trunk in the forest where it resides bears
the marks of his chisel. Wherever it perceives
a tree beginning to decay, it examines
it round and round and with great
skill and dexterity strips off the bark in
sheets of five or six feet in length, to get
at the hidden cause of the disease, and
labors with a gayety and activity really
surprising. I have seen it separate the
greatest part of the bark from a large,
dead pine tree, for twenty or thirty feet,
in less than a quarter of an hour.
Whether engaged in flying from tree to
tree, in digging, climbing or barking, he
seems perpetually in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the mating season it is exceedingly
noisy, not only spending much
time in drumming, but also frequently uttering
its love notes which to Mr. Nehrling
sounds like &ldquo;a-wuck, a-wuck.&rdquo; Mr.
Chapman describes their usual call note
as a &ldquo;sonorous cow-cow-cow, repeated
rather slowly many times,&rdquo; and when
two birds come together they utter a
&ldquo;wichew note&rdquo; similar to that of the
flicker. Its note of alarm has been likened
to an oft-repeated ha-he, ha-he, ha-he.
The same observer hears in its call
note a constant repetition of a-wick, a-wick
and at times tack-tack-tack.</p>
<p>For its nest the Pileated Woodpecker
excavates cavities in tree trunks at
heights varying from twenty to eighty
feet above the ground. Both sexes assist
in the work of making the cavity which,
Major Bendire states, &ldquo;vary from seven
to thirty inches in depth, and is gradually
enlarged toward the bottom, where it
is about six inches wide.&rdquo; He also says
that it takes from seven to twelve days
to complete it and when completed it is
quite an artistic piece of work, the walls
of the cavity being quite smooth and the
edges of the entrance being nicely beveled.
The eggs are usually deposited on
a layer of chips. Not infrequently every
chip, as soon as it is loosened, is removed
to a distance in order to remove every
trace of the nesting site.</p>
<p>Birds as well as other animals are afflicted
with parasitic worms. Mr. Langdon
found on dissecting a Pileated Woodpecker,
a &ldquo;slender tape-worm about fifteen
inches long and one-thirty-second of
an inch wide,&rdquo; and in the tissues beneath
the skin of the neck &ldquo;were two thread-like,
round worms of a pale pinkish tint
and about three-fourths of an inch in
length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this wonderful bird we may truthfully
say with Mr. Langille, &ldquo;Whether
one notes his strong flight, his elastic
bounding and springing along the trunks
of the trees, the effective chiseling of his
powerful bill, or his sonorous cackling,
one is particularly impressed with the
spirit and immense energy of the bird.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4">&ldquo;HAMMOCK STORIES.&rdquo;
<br /><span class="small">MRS. FIG TREE&rsquo;S FAMILY HISTORY.</span></h2>
<p>It was a nice, bright, sunshiny day,
and the trees were freshly washed from a
warm rain the night before, but it seemed
to me when I first lay down in my hammock
that they were not in as good humor
as usual. Mrs. Pepper Tree had
lost her sprightly manner, and her voice
was quite peevish when, seeing some
children pass on their way from school,
she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats me what those children do
day after day, and year after year!
They can&rsquo;t be very smart or they would
have learned all their lessons long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Liveoak reminded her that
according to what she had heard tell,
children had a lot more to learn than
trees; that they were obliged to study
about people and everything they ever
did, and about stones and birds and the
sky and the flowers, and bugs and flies
and the rest, and she expected it took
them some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume they spend a great deal of
their time studying my family history,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Fig Tree. &ldquo;It is a very old and
important one, and even grown people
go to big buildings when the bells ring,
and read and learn about my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was as satisfied, oh, just as
satisfied as could be, and she seemed to be
quite pleased over something while she
was talking. Mrs. Pepper gave her
branches a toss, as she crossly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what there is in Fig
Trees to study over much! All they
have anyhow is queer awkward looking
leaves in the spring, then green figs
growing right out of the branches, no
flowers or anything, then by and by all
the leaves dropping off again! I wouldn&rsquo;t
think that would take much time or was
worth much time either, and for my part
I wouldn&rsquo;t have leaves I couldn&rsquo;t keep all
the year round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fig answered her in a very polite
tone, just as if she was talking to company:
&ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Pepper, but
probably you never heard that it was my
family that gave the first man and woman
who ever lived in the world their
clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pepper said she never heard it,
and she guessed no one else ever did
either. But you could see she was getting
curious, and so were the other trees,
and they finally asked Mrs. Fig to tell
them, and so she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long, long ago there was the most
beautiful garden that ever was heard or
thought of and every lovely flower that
grows, and every tree that amounts to
anything, was there. But the rose bushes
had no thorns, and there were no spiders
or bugs or worms to bother the trees and
shrubs, but only great butterflies as bright
as the rainbow. And there were no
brambles or thistles or burrs, but only
violets and clover blossoms and other
flowers, and all the birds sang more
sweetly than the nightingale, and the
fountains were clear and sparkling, and
the fruit was always ripe, and everything
was just as beautiful as could be,
and the first man and woman were the
most beautiful of all, only they didn&rsquo;t
have any clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pine rustled his needles in an embarrassed
sort of way, and Grandma
Liveoak said that didn&rsquo;t seem just the
right thing, somehow; but Mrs. Fig
calmly remarked: &ldquo;That was what they
thought too and so they made themselves
lovely clothes out of fig leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pepper guessed that that wouldn&rsquo;t
help them much; that clothes made out of
fig leaves would amount to no clothes at
all. But here Mr. Pine spoke, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I might with propriety venture a
suggestion on so delicate a subject, I
think possibly it was bathing suits the
first man and woman made of the fig
leaves. My friend, the East Wind, assures
me that&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Pepper, &ldquo;rubbish!
I don&rsquo;t believe that they ever made
any clothes of her old leaves at all, so
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Mrs. Fig&rsquo;s voice was so polite
it made me quite nervous, and she
spoke very slowly. &ldquo;The first man and
woman went to all of the other trees
and looked their leaves over very carefully,
but none of them were good or
pretty enough, and finally they came to
the Fig tree.&rdquo; Here Mrs. Fig made a
long pause, repeating, &ldquo;Finally they came
to the Fig tree. And the first woman
said: &lsquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t these leaves just too
lovely for anything! The Fig tree is the
best and prettiest of all. We will make
our clothes out of her leaves. And so they
did, and what&rsquo;s more, they got into a
whole lot of trouble just because they
had something to do with another tree besides
the Fig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pepper rubbed two branches together,
and it made the most sneery sound
you ever heard, as she asked: &ldquo;I suppose
you want me to believe that &lsquo;other tree&rsquo;
was the pepper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Fig, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
there were any pepper trees in the garden
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then you should have seen how
angry Mrs. Pepper grew and I did wish
that Grandma Liveoak would hurry and
say something so there would be peace;
but sure as you live, when she spoke her
voice sounded strange and very dignified,
and she only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other trees may have family histories
too, Mrs. Fig, if they chose to
boast of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poet once said,&rdquo; began Mr. Pine.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Orange Tree interrupted him
to ask what they were saying about her;
that she heard &ldquo;best and prettiest
leaves&rdquo; mentioned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fig told the story all over again,
and I wanted to explain to her that I
had never heard it just that way; but her
stubby branches were standing very firm
and determined, and I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t
do a bit of good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poets,&rdquo; said Mr. Pine, &ldquo;are the wisest
people in the world, and one of them&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a twig for the first man
or the first woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pepper
crossly. &ldquo;I know all the painters choose
me, and they put my leaves and my clusters
of white blossoms and red berries
on paper and boards, and painters are the
people of all the earth who know what is
beautiful, so that proves the first place
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This poet once said of our family,&rdquo;
Mr. Pine began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brides all choose me,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Orange, &ldquo;and who in the world is so important
as a bride? And if they choose
me, I must be first and prettiest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I remarked,&rdquo; said Mr. Pine, &ldquo;this
poet&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But such a noise you never heard, and
even Grandma Liveoak as bad as the
rest, and Mrs. Pepper and Mrs. Fig and
Mrs. Orange, all claiming so many things
for their family. And they got to saying
unkind things to each other&mdash;they really
did&mdash;and you have no idea how dreadfully
sarcastic trees can be. But just as
I was wondering however it would all
come out Mrs. Pepper stopped still for a
minute, then leaned her graceful boughs
fringed with fine narrow leaves way over
until they kissed Mrs. Fig&rsquo;s bare
branches, and said gently: &ldquo;I am sure it
was a great honor to have your pretty
leaves chosen by the first man and woman,
and I am very sorry I was cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Liveoak gave a little laugh,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Well, what a silly old tree I
am! Do you know, I came very near being
a little put out there, just for a second,
simply because another tree mentioned
her family.&rdquo; Then she praised
Mrs. Fig and told her it was a good
thing to think well of one&rsquo;s own sap and
wood. And Mrs. Fig said she might
have been mistaken about what the first
woman said, and that probably she took
the fig leaves because they were the handiest
or something. And Mrs. Orange
got the wind to blow over some of her
prettiest blossoms to the other trees,
while high above Mockingbird was singing
and over on the hedge a meadow lark
gave its call, and it was all very sweet
and pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; calmly remarked
Mr. Pine, &ldquo;a poet once said of our family:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who is the king of all the wood?</p>
<p class="t0">Be it distinctly understood</p>
<p class="t7">It is the Pine!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c5">BUILDING FOR BIRD TENANTS.</h2>
<p>When on walking through a city park
on a blustery winter day one suddenly
spies the little bird houses, built by the
custodian and perched high up among
the branches of the trees, a smile invariably
creeps over the face and a thought
of summer steals into the tired brain.
Would that the building of bird houses
became more fashionable among our
boys!</p>
<p>One of the simplest and most artistic
of them may be formed from a cocoanut
shell. The opening may be so made that
the piece of shell cut out can be turned
up like a little porch roof over the door.
If these be fixed just at nest-building
time and the architect should kindly
leave the nut inside the shell the birds
will be most grateful.</p>
<p>Down south many of the door-yard
trees seem to be growing gourd fruit.
In reality the gourds (with an opening
in the side of each) are tied on or hung
there by means of their own crooked
necks to make nests for the birds.</p>
<p>Sometimes one may see whole rows
of them upon a pole which is nailed to
a stable roof and often they are found
hanging to the ragged edge of the roof
of a negro cabin. As far as I can learn,
the idea originated with the colored people,
who take great pride in the number
of birds they can attract about them by
this and other kindly means. The little
yellow houses seem to delight the
birds so much that one is seldom put up
in vain, and the tenants pay lavishly with
coins of song and many a trill of joy.</p>

<br />(Sturnus vulgaris).

<h2 id="c7">THE STARLING.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The Starling belongs to an interesting
family of birds, represented in America
by but one species and that one only recently
introduced. In the Old World,
however, there are about two hundred
species which are widely distributed
throughout Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>The common Starling is a native of
Europe and northern Asia and is admitted
to the bird fauna of North America
both because of its accidental occurence
in Greenland and of its introduction
into the parks of New York city.
Regarding its introduction into this
country, Mr. Chapman says that it has
been brought across the ocean on several
occasions, but only in the case of the
last importation was the effort to make
it establish a home within our borders a
success. &ldquo;The birds included in this lot,
about sixty in number, were released in
Central Park, New York city, in 1890.
They seem to have left the park and to
have established themselves in various
favorable places in the upper part of the
city. They have bred for three successive
years in the roof of the Museum of
Natural History and at other points in
the vicinity. In the suburbs about the
northern end of the city they are frequently
observed in flocks containing as
many as fifty individuals.&rdquo; From the
fact that it is a resident throughout the
year and has endured our most severe
winters Mr. Chapman thinks that the
species may be regarded as thoroughly
naturalized.</p>
<p>The common Starling easily adapts
itself to its environment and can withstand
quite a diversity of climatic conditions.
However, while it was introduced
with difficulty in the eastern United
States, efforts made to introduce it into
the State of Oregon have not met with
success. Wherever the conditions are
favorable it breeds rapidly and not uncommonly
a pair will rear two broods in
a season.</p>
<p>This engaging bird has commanded
the attention of observers for centuries.
Pliny speaks of it in his Natural History,
and one writer has said that &ldquo;its
varied song, its sprightly gestures, its
glossy plumage, and, above all its character
as an insecticide&mdash;which last
makes it a friend of the agriculturist
and the grazier&mdash;render it an almost
universal favorite.&rdquo; Some of the notes
of the Starling&rsquo;s song are harsh but on
the whole the song is pleasing and
&ldquo;heard as they are, at a season when
every sign of returning spring is eagerly
looked for and welcomed, are certainly
one of the most cheerful sounds that
greet the ear.&rdquo; Its whole energy is
thrown into the song, which is uttered
with ruffled feathers. It is also a mimic
of no mean order. One authority says
that it delights &ldquo;in reproducing familiar
sounds with the greatest fidelity to truth.
We have heard individual Starlings reproduce
the call notes of the skylark,
goldfinch, wagtail, and other small
birds; sometimes we have been startled
on a winter&rsquo;s day to recognize the cry of
the common sandpiper or the grating
call note of a fern owl in the middle of
a crowded city, and have discovered the
author of our astonishment in the person
of a Starling, that is pouring forth
his rhapsodies from some neighboring
chimney top.&rdquo; Pliny says: &ldquo;Agrippina,
the wife of Claudius Caesar, had a
thrush that could imitate the human
speech, a thing that was never known
before. At the moment that I am writing
this, the young Caesars have a Starling
and some nightingales that are being
taught to talk in Greek and Latin; besides
which, they are studying their task
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
the whole day, continually repeating the
new words that they have learnt, and
giving utterance to phrases even of considerable
length.&rdquo; The young birds are
very noisy and while feeding and training
them the parents are scarcely less so.
So great, in fact, is this noisy babble that
it often becomes very unpleasant.</p>
<p>The Starling is a gregarious bird at all
times, but this habit is more marked after
the breeding season has passed. It
has its favorite haunts and, though a
flock may be dispersed during the daytime
while feeding, all will congregate
in the favorite locality at nightfall. Mr.
William Yarrell, in his &ldquo;British Birds,&rdquo;
gives an interesting anecdote regarding
the abundance and social habits of the
Starling. Speaking of an English estate,
he says, &ldquo;This locality is an evergreen
plantation covering several acres,
to which these birds repair in an evening&mdash;I
was going to say, and I believe
I might truly say&mdash;by millions, from the
low ground about the Severn, where
their noise is something altogether unusual.
By packing in such myriads upon
the evergreens, they have stripped them
of their leaves, except just at the tops,
and have driven the pheasants, for whom
the plantation was intended, quite away
from the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding their nesting and mating
habits Mr. Henry Seebohm says: &ldquo;Early
in April, sometimes not until the beginning
of May, the Starlings have mostly
mated and gone to their breeding holes.
Previous to this, however, much quarreling
goes on for the choice of suitable
sites. The strong gain the best holes,
while the weak seek quarters elsewhere.
The Starling will build its nest almost
anywhere, and it needs but slight encouragement
to take up its quarters in
any suitable hole or box placed for its
reception. It will even dislodge large
tiles and burrow considerable distances
under the eaves, and its bulky nest often
stops up some spout, to the dismay of
the householder. A hole in the gable
or inside the dovecot are also favorite
places, while its partiality for holes in
the trees is none the less. It also commonly
breeds in ruins, churches, and old
masonry of every description. In the
wilder portions of the country the Starling
selects a hole either in a tree or a
rock for its purpose, and it will often
breed in great numbers in caves or in
crevices of the ocean cliffs.&rdquo; The nest
is not a fine piece of bird architecture.
It is coarse and slovenly constructed
with dry grass, fibers, twigs, small roots,
rags, twine, paper and in fact of any substance
that strikes the fancy of the bird.
It is lined, though not always, with wool,
vegetable down and feathers. At times
when the nest is placed in hollow trees
the bedding consists of powdered wood.
The Starling returns to the same site
year after year, but always builds a new
nest.</p>
<p>Though the Starling will often pilfer
fruit trees, especially late in the season,
it is of great service to man, for its chief
food consists of worms, larvae and various
adult insects. It is a voracious
feeder and thus destroys a large number
of forms of insect life, many of which
are very destructive to plant life. It &ldquo;is
almost as closely associated with man
as the sparrow,&rdquo; but unlike the sparrow
it is much more able to adapt itself to a
change of surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c8">NOVEMBER.</h2>
<p>November sits at the door of her wayside
tent looking out upon the valleys
and mountain tops. She has torn from
the trees their faded banners of yellow
and their worn fringes of crimson. November
is an old dame, gray-haired, somber-eyed
and strong-featured. Clad
in garments of dun and dusky
brown, she sits resting and smoking;
and that is why we get such smoky days
toward the last of her stay.</p>
<p>Yes, November is an old gypsy dame,
but she is not always melancholy. She
is the month of whom artists are especially
fond. While she lacks the glow
of midsummer, there is compensation for
the absence of bloom and radiance in
the ripening of all vegetation; there is
still a touch of splendid color on the
hills, and the grass is green with the
aftermath of summer. Beautiful mists
veil the mountain tops. There is an exquisite
beauty in the tints of sepia and
the rich brown tones of the landscapes
and in the tender grays and clear blues
of November skies.</p>
<p>Ah, she knows, does November, that
she, too, in her old age, gives promise
of something sweet to come. All the
trees are filled with next year&rsquo;s buds; the
trailing things of the woods, too, are
budded and wait but a few months until
the first snows are gone to blossom
in fragrance and gladden the bright wedding
days of Spring.</p>
<p>Calmly she smokes, the dear old dame,
sitting at the door of her tent. Near
by, dim and misty, are the marshy fens,
in which stand the herons like sculptured
figures, where the bulrushes have turned
yellow amongst the tawny tussocks.
Around her the Indian creeper weaves
its still brilliant strands of red and gold.
Softly the willow bands drop their trailing
leaves. Heavy and purple still hang
the berries on the elder boughs that
languidly wave in the faint breeze as if
they still felt the ghosts of summer kisses.</p>
<p>The nut-brown face of old November
looks impassively on all the changes of
her season. She knows nothing is dying
about her that shall not live again. Her
eyes, dark, liquid, somberly deep and
tranquil, have seen all the things beautiful
that our eyes have missed&mdash;the wild
flowers trodden down by careless feet;
moonlight on far off lakes at midnight;
the first pink flush of dawn on stately
mountains. Ah, yes, she knows of Love;
of dead folded hands, and she remembers
the buds of her last year&rsquo;s reign.
She knows that, like the sleeping buds
about her now, Love shall give all things
back again in the sweet springtime of
Paradise, even as these same buds shall
waken to bloom and beauty when their
winter sleep is over.</p>
<p>But now the night is coming on. Deep
shadows are filling the dusky stalls of the
drooping hemlocks on yonder hill. Faint
spicy odors of sweet fern and illusive
witch hazel rise on the misty air. Dame
November rises slowly, knocks the ashes
from her pipe, gazes broodingly for a
few moments over the fading landscape,
then turns and softly closes her door.
All night the solemn winds intone the
requiem of Spring and Summer glories
past, but at intervals listen and you will
hear the sweet, thin flute of the wood-frog,
faintly but hopefully voicing the
promise of another Spring, with more
bloom, more gladness and glory to come.</p>
<p>Dear old Dame November! A few
more days and she will no longer be sitting
at the door of her wayside tent. We
love her mists, her mellow rains, her dull,
rich tones of brown and faded gold. December
shall disturb the brooding calm
that she has left with us, but we know
he cannot harm with his icy mail and
glittering frost spears the tightly folded
promises which the gypsy November has
prepared for next year&rsquo;s blooming.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE ARKANSAS GOLDFINCH.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Spinus psaltria</i>.)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Goldfinch, social, chirping, bright,</p>
<p class="t0">Takes in those branches his delight.</p>
<p class="t0">A troop like flying sunbeams pass</p>
<p class="t0">And light among the vivid grass,</p>
<p class="t0">Or in the end of some long branch,</p>
<p class="t0">Like acrobats, in air they launch,</p>
<p class="t0">And in the wild wind sway and swing,</p>
<p class="t0">Intent to twitter, glance and sing.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="sc">Rose Terry Cooke</span>, &ldquo;My Apple Tree.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These lines of the poet were inspired
by the beautiful goldfinch so familiar to
all, and usually called yellow-bird and
thistle-bird. They form an appropriate
introduction to a few words regarding
the thistle-bird&rsquo;s sister species of the
Pacific coast&mdash;the Arkansas Goldfinch.
This bright and sprightly bird enlivens
the shrubby ravines and weedy places
from Oregon southward through the
United States, and from the Pacific
coast eastward into Colorado. Throughout
its range it is quite common and
nests on the plains and also in the mountains
to a height of nine thousand feet.
Abundant in many mountainous regions,
it has been given the name Rocky Mountain
Goldfinch, and the olive-green color
of the plumage of its back has given it
the very appropriate name Arkansas
Green-backed Goldfinch.</p>
<p>Like the common thistle-bird, it has a
social disposition and feeds with its fellows
in flocks of a greater or less number.
Not infrequently several individuals
will alight on the same plant and
immediately begin a diligent search for
their food of seeds. Active and of a
seemingly impatient temperament, it seldom
remains long in any one locality,
yet a garden rich in sunflower blossoms
or a field full of blooming thistles furnished
so tempting a larder that a flock
may patiently labor therein for some
time, gathering an abundance of goldfinch
dainties.</p>
<p>Its notes are similar to those of the
thistle-birds. &ldquo;The ordinary note is a
plaintive mellow, whistling call, impossible
to describe and so inflected as
to produce a very mournful effect.&rdquo;
While pursuing its undulating flight, it
utters a sweet song which is in harmony
with the rise and fall of its onward motion
and is indicative of its sweet disposition.
Its nest is a dainty structure
built of fine bark and other vegetable
fibers, fine grasses and moss compactly
bound together and quite thickly lined
with plant down.</p>

<h2 id="c10">TRAGEDY IN BIRD LIFE.</h2>
<p>For the friends of birds there are, in
cold days of wind and storm, opportunities
of loving service.</p>
<p>In the drama of bird-life the scenes
are ever shifting, and struggle for existence
is not always under sun-lighted,
genial skies.</p>
<p>It is true that creative love has endowed
the birds with facilities for resisting
the havoc of storms. The feathered
tribes, nested in chosen coverts, defy
the elements and shake out their plumage
in fearless defiance of tempests before
which man stands in dismay.</p>
<p>A little bit of feathered anatomy will
sway cheerily on unprotected twigs, disdaining
the shelter close at hand, while
the storm beats on wayside.</p>
<p>The endurance of these creatures of
the air may well astonish men, who, with
all their vitality and size, succumb, of
necessity, to the warring elements.</p>
<p>But, in spite of their powers of endurance,
the storm-periods are for the birds
bitter intervals of life, when hunger and
thirst and cold combine to sweep them
into the vortex of the lost.</p>
<p>It is not the cold, unaccompanied by
other influences, which devastates the
ranks of the birds during extreme winter
storm-periods, however; it is, chiefly, the
dearth of food.</p>
<p>While the harvest of seeds over the
meadows is available the bleak blast
moans about our birds innoxiously; but
it is when the feathery snowflakes cover
this well-stocked granary, clinging about
the seed-vessels of weed and flower, and
closing it in a frozen locker, or the ice-storm
wraps it in glittering ice, that the
lairds are beaten before the winds, and
perish of cold and starvation.</p>
<p>There are few, if any, bird lovers who
have not some scene of tragedy to recount;
some memory of storm-periods
when the birds flew to the habitations of
men for help, finding no hope but in the
fragments cast away by some human
hand.</p>
<p>That more thought is not given to the
needs of the birds about our doors, at such
periods, is due more to the prevailing impression
that the birds have the means of
providing, even in times of emergency,
for their own needs, than to a disregard
of the interests of these little friends of
the air.</p>
<p>Unless we have awakened to pathetic
struggle of bird life under some conditions
we are not apt to be aroused to any
obligation in the matter of aiding in providing
for birds in seasons of peril.</p>
<p>But it is true, nevertheless, that the little
visitor upon our doorsill who stays
with us during the long winter suffers
the anguish of cold and hunger, frequently
of starvation, during the periods of
intense cold and storm&mdash;anguish which
might be prevented by a little thoughtfulness
on man&rsquo;s part, in casting a trifle of
food in sheltered nooks&mdash;crumbs from the
table; cracked corn or coarse meal;
cracked nuts; a bit of suet, the latter being
best served by being nailed upon
some neighboring tree, high enough to be
beyond the reach of any but the intended
guests.</p>
<p>By such provision one phase of the
tragedy of bird-life would be abated, and
the friendliness of the little strangers developed,
to the pleasure of many bird
lovers, who would receive in return for
their kindness the gladness sure to be
theirs in watching the feast of the joyous
birds.</p>
<p>The day when earth and sky meet in
one maze of blinding snow, or in the
mist of rain which freezes where it falls,
is hard enough for the birds; but while
there is light there is also a hope of a
scanty meal to be caught somewhere
through the swirl of the storm. But,
when this hope fails and darkness lowers
into deepening night; when bleak winds
rage on every side; the forests creak and
moan; the tormented air sobs and wails
like a tortured soul; when every sound is
swept into the cadence of despair and the
outposts of hills are lost in the labyrinth
of tumultuous night, then how bitter is
life&rsquo;s tragedy for the hunger-racked
birds; how marvelous it is that so many
little storm-beaten breasts survive to
meet the struggle for existence at the
dawn of a new storm-beaten day.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE LIFE OF AIRY WINGS.</h2>
<p>One beautiful day last May my
mother laid a tiny green egg on the under
side of a leaf on a milkweed plant.
I know that its color was green and that
it was laid on the back of the leaf because
Mother Milkweed Butterfly did
not want any fly or worm to eat me
up, so she made its green like the leaf
and hid it away in a safe place. There I
rested quietly within the egg for about
four days, when I burst open the shell
to see what was out in the world.</p>
<p>I shook myself and found that I could
crawl. I was also very hungry. I had
come out a green caterpillar with a black
head. How strange that was! Now I
expected to be a butterfly with wings to
sail through the air. Never mind, I
thought, if I am a caterpillar I must do
all that a caterpillar ought to do, and
not make a fuss because I am not a
handsome butterfly.</p>
<p>The first thing a caterpillar has to do
is to eat his eggshell so that the ichneumon
fly&mdash;the fellow is an enemy to my
family&mdash;will not be able to find any
traces of him on the leaf. Where did
I learn that? I think Mother B. must
have folded that thought in the eggshell,
for it came out with me. After doing
that duty I was so hungry that I ate the
leaf on which I found myself, all day
long and far into the night. Then I
curled up and went to sleep feeling very
quiet and comfortable.</p>
<p>When I awakened the sun was up. I
was warm and hungry, so I began to eat
again. Suddenly I heard a buzzing
noise overhead. Oh, dear me! I was
frightened and kept perfectly still, for
I thought it was that miserable fly after
me, but it proved to be only a jolly bumble-bee,
and I went on eating.</p>
<p>After several days of this life&mdash;eating,
and watching for enemies&mdash;something
happened. I suppose that I had eaten
so much milkweed that my skin got too
tight to hold me, for it felt very uncomfortable
and then began to crack. I had
spun a little silk on the leaf to get a better
foot-hold and remained very quiet
for I did not feel like moving. I
stretched my head a little, after awhile,
and the old head-case came off, falling
to the ground. Then I made violent
exertions, or movements, with the muscles
of my body, and finally the old
skin came off. I was very much fatigued
and was quiescent, not caring to
stir, for several hours. I thought of the
fly too, that might sting me now while
my new jacket was soft, and that kept
me still also. When it became harder
I had to eat up the old one, and then
was hungry as ever.</p>
<p>Eat! Why I did nothing for about
four weeks but devour milkweed, keep a
watch out for enemies and grow too big
for my jacket. I moulted four times
in all, and at the end you should have
seen me. My body was striped yellow,
black and green, and was nearly two
inches long. My head was black-banded; my
face yellow with two parallel
black bows, and I had two pairs of long
slender, flexible filaments, like a hair, on
my body.</p>
<p>I had grown so large and strong that
I wanted to see more of the world. I
crawled off my leaf, down the stalk of
the plant onto the ground. What a
queer sensation it was, to be sure, to feel
the grass and the ground! There was a
rail-fence near my old home. I began
to feel very weary and sleepy. I crept
cautiously along until I reached the
fence; crawled up to next the top rail
and under it to rest awhile. My, how
tired I was! I did not want anything to
eat. I did not care to move, nor to
speak. I caught hold of the rail and
hung there for about twelve days.</p>
<p>I have learned since, that I was a
chrysalis and was a beautiful object of
emerald green, with gold and black dots.
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
I was fastened to the fence-rail by a
slender shining black peduncle, or stem.
Nothing disturbed me, and on the
eleventh day the bright green disappeared,
the golden spots faded, and on
the twelfth day I burst open the shell
of the chrysalis, found that I had wings
and sailed away through the air. How
delightful! So much easier than crawling.
At last I was a butterfly. This is
what patience and perseverance does for
the &ldquo;ugly duckling,&rdquo; at least that is what
a friend on the milkweed leaf told me
one day.</p>
<p>I saw another butterfly a short distance
ahead of me having the same colors
I had&mdash;yellow and black with white
dots on the wings&mdash;and I flew faster to
catch up with her. She was very beautiful
and knew more of the world than
I did, therefore I determined to keep
close to her. I found her very modest
and unassuming. She made me feel as
if I knew it all, and that is the chief
qualification that even a butterfly wants
in a wife. After a little hesitation I
asked her to be my mate. She said she
would, and away we raced in the sunshine
to a field of clover. She showed
me how to get honey out of the flowers
with my tongue, which is like a watch-spring
coiled up in the lower part of my
head. When I am excited in probing to
the bottom of a flower it uncoils and
half coils again, &ldquo;acting like a little
force-pump&rdquo; to bring up the juice of
the flower.</p>
<p>My mate and I had a jolly time flying
over the clover-field, where we met more
of our family, the milkweed butterflies,
and others. The flowers we like best
are the clover, milkweed, goldenrod,
thistle and phlox.</p>
<p>I soon discovered that birds and insects
did not trouble us much, because
we do not suit their appetites. They say
that we taste bitter and disagreeable,
like the milkweed, so they seldom disturb
us, and we lead a happy-go-lucky
life. We often spread our wings wide
and float along in the air with little fear
of foes. They see our colors&mdash;yellow
and black, the badge of the milkweed
butterfly&mdash;and off they go seeking a
choicer tidbit.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a heavy wind storm
I fly out to battle with it. What fun
to have the angry wind hurl you back&mdash;only
to get your wings fluttering again,
and flying a distance to meet another
fling! It is great sport.</p>
<p>I must tell you of something that
happened to my mate one day. She was
flying near a piazza where there were
some phlox plants. She darted down
towards them, keeping an eye out on a
sparrow that had been flying after her,
when her right wing caught in a spider-web
that was in the piazza rail. She
fluttered and fluttered, frightening the
spider out of his web, until she got her
wing loose; but it was not so strong after
that, as a little piece was torn off.</p>
<p>I saw some beautiful flowers lying on
a table on the same piazza soon afterwards
and, as no one was out there,
winged down on them. Queer: they
had no honey in them. A little girl in
the window exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, sister! a
butterfly is on our paper flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a boy sprang out with a hat in
his hand and I flew quickly away. My
mate and I were so terrified that we did
not go near that piazza again.</p>
<p>The lovely warm summer passed very
soon and I had such a happy time that
I was sorry when our family flocked together
and began to talk of going South
in September. We held our meetings
on the underside of the branches of
trees and, perhaps, some of you saw us
there.</p>
<p>Oh! the life of a butterfly is sweet,
and there is just enough excitement in
keeping out of the reach of enemies to
make the struggle for existence interesting.</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE CELESTIAL BIRD.</h2>
<p>The ancients called the eagle the celestial
bird because it flies high with its
eye fixed on the sun.</p>
<p>According to the myths of the birds
they are older than the gods and to them
mankind is deeply indebted; for the
hawk created man, the wren, and not
Prometheus, brought down fire for his
use, the crow taught him marital laws,
while the eagle gave him the brew from
the fountain of song. Just why the eagle&mdash;who
is no musician&mdash;should have interested
himself in this way, legend does
not explain, but, as he is of majestic appearance,
and imperial in character,
there can be no possible objection to his
acting as cup-bearer to the poets! They
all like him&mdash;or, at least, like to describe
him. Tennyson says&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He clasps the crag with crooked hands</p>
<p class="t0">Close to the sun in lonely lands</p>
<p class="t0">Ring&rsquo;d with the azure world he stands.</p>
<p class="t0">The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls,</p>
<p class="t0">He watches from his northern walls,</p>
<p class="t0">And like a thunderbolt he falls.</p>
</div>
<p>But the eagle takes part in the affairs
of birds and beasts, as well as in those of
men, for, according to an oriental legend,
in ancient times beasts and birds were
at war with each other. While victory
was still uncertain the owl withdrew
from the winged army quite prepared
to go over to the enemy. But the
eagle fought with such valorous prowess
that the birds were finally victorious.
The owl, seeing this, flew back to join
them. But the eagle observed his movements,
and forbade him ever again to
mix with his subjects or show his face
to the sun.</p>
<p>Although the eagle is a bird of prey he
is used as a national emblem on Persian,
Roman and United States coins. Indeed,
the eagle is often used for heraldic
emblems, standards and various emblematic
devices. The eagle is cosmopolitan.
The so-called bald-eagle takes
three years to complete its plumage; it
is called the &ldquo;black&rdquo; eagle the first year,
the &ldquo;gray&rdquo; the second and the &ldquo;bald&rdquo; the
third year, when the white plumage on
neck and head, which gives it the name,
is complete. After shedding its feathers
in the spring, even the old birds assume
the appearance of youth, hence David
speaks of the &ldquo;youth which is renewed
like the eagle&rsquo;s.&rdquo; An unusual fact in
reference to this bird is that the female
is said to be larger and braver than the
male.</p>
<p>A story is told of a pair of eagles in
the New York Zoological Park who
made a nest in the root of a tree, in a
cavity of the ground and lined it with
moss. As no eggs were yet ready the
birds brought a smooth round stone to
the nest on which they sat, male and female,
on alternate days. Some such
habit as this may account for the idea
of the ancients that the eagle carried
stones to her nest to facilitate the laying
of her eggs.</p>
<p>The eagle lives to be very old. It is
not especially difficult to tame. A young
one caught in the Territory could not be
bought. The Indian woman who was
taming it refused all offers. She said,
&ldquo;Ah-cha-fa-tona wants young eagle, she
not want white man&rsquo;s money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Abe&rdquo;&mdash;named for Lincoln&mdash;was
caught and tamed by soldiers during the
civil war. He went through the war
delighted with battles. One of his feathers,
dropped on the battlefield, was
framed and now hangs in Washington.</p>

<h2 id="c13">THE BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Charadrius squatarola</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The Black-bellied Plover is quite cosmopolitan,
though its range is practically
confined to the northern hemisphere,
passing southward in the winter to the
West Indies and northern South America
and breeding in the far North. Not
only is its range extensive, but also its
list of common or local names. Some of
the better known of these are Whistling
Field Plover, May Cock, Beetle-head,
Black-breast and Bottle-head. Its large
head has given it the name Bull-head and
its large, brilliant and expressive dark
colored eyes, which in summer are surrounded
by a white ring, have led some
of its admirers to call it the Ox-eye.</p>
<p>The Black-bellied Plover is grouse-like
in appearance and differs from all the
other plovers in having a rudimentary
hind toe. It varies greatly in the color of
its plumage, both with age and with the
seasons. As it stands upon the beach,
decked in its summer plumage, it is a
striking and beautiful bird. As winter
approaches its plumage assumes a more
somber hue and becomes a mixture of
dark brown and gray above, while below
the plumage is white with lines and spots
of dark brown on the neck and breast.</p>
<p>This bird is one of the largest of the
plover species. It will run rapidly for a
few yards and suddenly stopping will
elevate its head and closely survey its
environment. The older birds are shy,
but the younger ones will quite readily
respond to the call of the hunter and will
usually approach his decoys. Its call
notes are of two kinds. One is loud and
penetrating and may be heard at a long
distance. This call consists of a number
of distinct notes, the second of which is
accented. The notes of the other call are
uttered in a low and satisfied tone as if
the bird were perfectly contented. Mr.
George H. Mackay found much to admire
in the life of this Plover. He says:
&ldquo;There is something very aristocratic in
the bearing of the adult birds as you
watch them standing on the marsh with
their heads erect, their black and white
plumage strikingly defined, and their
large, dark, liquid eyes ever on the alert
for danger. With the yellowish green
marsh grass for a background, they make
a most interesting study in black and
white, which, coupled with that clear penetrating
note of alarm when danger is discovered,
cannot fail to impress one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When migrating it may fly alone or in
flocks. At times the flocks will assume
a wedge-shaped or a crescent-like form.
The latter seems to be the more common
form, and the ends of the crescent may
point either forward or backward. The
solitary birds are more frequent in the
interior, while the flocks are more common
near the sea coast. The slow and
measured stroke of the long wings is well
fitted to a continuous and prolonged
flight. When tired from flying at sea it
will rest on masses of seaweed or float
upon the water.</p>
<p>The Black-bellied Plover feeds largely
on minute mollusks, shrimps, worms, sea
insects and on various larvae found in the
marshes. It also eats grasshoppers and
late in the season, at the North, berries
form a large part of its diet. It is at
this time that its flesh is most eagerly
sought by the connoisseur of game food.
Food is gathered with a quick stroke and
from the surface, for the bird cannot
probe for its food as do the sandpipers.</p>
<p>This Plover is a tide bird, &ldquo;seeking
a large portion of its food on those extensive
sand flats left by the receding
waters, which may be adjacent to marshes
where the grass is short, and which are
interspersed with barren places where
there is no grass, also to uplands and
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
fields where the grass is scanty or closely
fed down by sheep or cattle. It is to
such places that they like to resort when
driven from their feeding grounds on the
sand flats by the incoming tide. They
also frequent, at such times, the crest
and dry sand of the beaches and shoals;
here they remain until the tide has sufficiently
ebbed to permit them again to return
to feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Black-bellied Plover gives but
little attention to home building. Its
nest is a mere depression in the ground
lined with grass and leaves.</p>
<h2 id="c14">SOME BIRD WONDERS.</h2>
<p>Geologically considered, the migration
of birds had its origin in the beginning of
the Post-Tertiary period of our globe&rsquo;s
history. Prior to the Glacial Epoch there
was no migratory instinct among the
feathered tribes of the earth&rsquo;s fauna for
the simple reason that there was no necessity
for such a change of habitat.</p>
<p>Thus the annual recurrence of this
phenomenon has been going on not since
the creation, as many suppose, but for
units of ages whose lapse can be reckoned
only by millenniums of calendar
years. It is not the time and place here
to discuss the means by which this length
of time can be even approximately determined,
but there are certain inferences
and conclusions which are well endorsed
by scientific research.</p>
<p>For our present purpose it is quite sufficient
to say that the Glacial Epoch wholly
changed the climatic relations of the
polar and middle latitude regions of our
globe. From the semitropical conditions
which once perennially existed there,
these regions have since and for ages
been subject to the intense cold which
now periodically prevails within those
limits.</p>
<p>There is a growing conviction among
geologists that the intense cold of the
Glacial Epoch was caused by a change in
the eccentricity of the earth&rsquo;s orbit. If
this be true, then the &ldquo;Great Winter&rdquo; of
astronomers was reigning in all its severity
210,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The wild goose, his near relatives, the
brant and swan, and other aquatic feathered
races, made their appearance on the
fifth day of creation. &ldquo;And God said,
Let the waters bring forth abundantly
the moving creature that hath life, and
fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this fifth day of creation very
nearly corresponds to the Triassic and
Jurassic periods of Mesozoic Time in
Geology.</p>
<p>Although &ldquo;every winged fowl after his
kind&rdquo; is included in the bird category of
this creative act, it has been thought, and
for good reasons, that the more highly
organized birds other than the aquatic
tribes, did not make their appearance till
the sixth day of the Mosaic account,
which would be exactly represented by
the Tertiary Period of Cenozoic Time.
According to this view, then, the wild
goose is an older denizen of our world
than the smaller birds of passage which
make their home on the land only.</p>
<p>But Geology fills up many niches and
supplies many details left blank in the
first chapter of Genesis. It is now one
of the firmly established tenets among
geologists that between the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic times there came a tremendous
disturbance in the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Story of the Earth,&rdquo; Dr. J.
Dorman Steele says, &ldquo;The Mesozoic
time, like the Palaeozoic, was closed by
mighty upheavals. The conditions of
life were changed. All the Mesozoic
types disappeared; hardly any species
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
survived the shock.&rdquo; A few individuals
did survive, however, and among them
was our venerable friend, the wild goose.</p>
<p>Having now finished the prefatory portion
of our story, the reader will be better
able to understand what may follow.</p>
<p>There is something wonderful, a conception,
indeed, which smacks little short
of the sublime in contemplating the protracted
journeyings of the larger aquatic
birds of passage. Especially is this true
of the American wild goose, the brant
and the swan. The brant is the wild
goose of Great Britain and continental
Europe; a much smaller bird than his
American relative; and its migrations are
of comparatively short range.</p>
<p>The European domesticated swan, remains,
of course, the year round in the
country of his adoption.</p>
<p>Not so, however, with the American
goose and swan. Both the former, Anseres
hyperboreas, and the latter, Cygnus
buccinator, rear their young in the Arctic
regions and spend the succeeding winter
with their offspring in the Gulf States
and Central America.</p>
<p>Think of these magnificent birds, those
on the Pacific coast flying from the
shores of the Arctic ocean in northern
Alaska and British America, crossing the
Rocky Mountains, and, after a journey
of four or five thousand miles, complacently
settling down in Texas, Mexico,
Yucutan, or Nicaragua, as the experienced
leaders may determine. Then turn
to those on the Atlantic side of the continent
and watch them as they leave the
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay country, cross the great
lakes and the Appalachian mountain system
to make a short winter sojourn
among the everglades of southern Florida.</p>
<p>In the tactics of these great birds while
performing their immense journeys there
is something remarkable even to the casual
observer. More than two thousand
years ago it was recorded by a student
of natural history that, &ldquo;Olores iter
facientes colla imponunt praecedentibus;
fessos duces ad terga recipiunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swans performing a journey rest
their necks upon those preceding; and
the leaders receive the weary ones upon
their backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this significant remark has often
been confirmed by modern observation.</p>
<p>Owing to the fact that they are more
sparsely distributed, that they fly much
higher and in smaller numbers than wild
geese, the swans are comparatively seldom
seen during their migratory flights
save in the fastnesses of mountainous
districts or at the extreme points of arrival
and departure. Hence we see why
so little is known concerning the details
of their aerial movements.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the semi-annual passage
of wild geese is not only a folk-lore
phenomenon, but a familiar spectacle to
the residents of cities and towns as well
as those who spend their days in the
rural districts. Now, there is more military
precision in the alignment of a large
flock of wild geese than the most careful
observer ever dreamed of or science investigated.</p>
<p>Here in the fastnesses of our Rocky
Mountains there are many exceptionally
good opportunities for watching the marvelous
evolutions of these birds.</p>
<p>While their flight may be a mile high
or more when spanning a level scope of
country, as in the prairie districts, they
barely clear the more elevated peaks
while crossing lofty mountain ranges.
Hence it will be seen that an observer on
either slope is much nearer the passing
birds than an inhabitant of the lower
levels or plains.</p>
<p>The well known acute angled form
assumed by wild geese in their annual
journeys is not a mere fortuitous conceit
on the part of the birds, but a true pattern
of that diagram formulated by the
anserine leaders of long agone prehistoric
ages; brave old heroes that piloted
their snowy hosts over the storm-lashed
wastes of northern latitudes while frost
and fire and glacier and drift were so
radically changing the topography of
our globe.</p>
<p>It can be shown that this particular
form of alignment in the flight of geese
is just as essential to the convenience
and vital interests of the birds as the
hexagonal form of honeycomb cells is
to the bees that construct and fill them
with honey. Nay, it is also true that no
other form of alignment in flight could
fulfill the conditions required; but we
cannot here explain the principles involved
in the interesting discussion.</p>

<h2 id="c15">THE DIAMOND.</h2>
<p>The Diamond is generally conceded to
be the most beautiful as it is the most important
of precious stones. While other
stones at times exceed it in value, weight
for weight, in total importance as an article
of commerce other gems are hardly
to be compared with it. Out of thirteen
and one-half millions of dollars&rsquo;
worth of precious stones imported into
the United States in 1900, twelve million
dollars&rsquo; worth were Diamonds. Not all
this amount was employed for jewelry,
since there is a large utilization of the
stone for industrial purposes, but even
for jewelry the Diamond has a largely
preponderating use. Its points of superiority
are its hardness, high refractive
powers and hence play of colors, its transparency
and its luster. In all these qualities
it excels any other known mineral.
Hence when in addition to these it exhibits
different body colors, as is sometimes
the case, no other gem can equal
it in value.</p>
<p>Usually the Diamond is colorless or
white, although shades of yellow are also
common. It is also known in shades of
red, green and blue and in brown and
black. The two latter are rarely transparent
and grade into the varieties known
as bort and carbonado, which have no
value as gems but are highly important
for industrial purposes.</p>
<p>In composition the Diamond is pure
carbon, thus not differing chemically
from graphite or such forms of carbon
as lamp-black, bone-black, etc. It is
crystallized, but this can be said of
graphite as well. Why carbon should
assume the form of Diamond in one case
and graphite in another, as well as being
amorphous in other occurrences, is not
known. Such behavior of a substance is
known as dimorphism, and numerous
illustrations of it are to be found in Nature.</p>
<p>Being pure carbon, Diamond can be
burned in the air. The finely divided
dust can be burned in the ordinary blow-pipe
flame, and for stones of ordinary
size a temperature of about 900&deg; C is
sufficient. The possibility of consuming
the Diamond by heat is said first to have
been suggested by Sir Isaac Newton, who
reasoned from the high refractive index
of the stone that it was &ldquo;an unctuous substance
coagulated,&rdquo; and hence probably
combustible. Following this suggestion
two Italians, Averani and Targioni, succeeded
in 1695 in burning some Diamonds
in a furnace, and since then the
experiment has been repeated many
times. The Diamond does not fuse in
burning, but after becoming heated to
redness gradually grows smaller, emitting
sparks, till it entirely disappears. It
leaves no ash except in the case of the
impure form known as carbonado. The
gas given off has been collected and analyzed
and found to be carbon dioxide
just as would result from the combustion
of other forms of carbon. If protected
from the air or free oxygen, the Diamond
can be exposed to high heat without
change.</p>
<p>Being a crystallized substance and excessively
hard the Diamond is usually
found in the form of more or less perfect
crystals. These have forms such as
the cube, octahedron, etc., which belong
to the isometric system, and it is in this
system that the Diamond crystallizes. The
crystals do not possess, however, the
highest isometric symmetry, but belong
to the class designated by Groth as hexakistetrahedral,
being tetrahedral with
inclined face hemihedrism. It is very
common for the faces to be curved instead
of flat and to show etching figures
of various kinds. The crystals are often
considerably distorted so as to produce
pointed and rounded forms, and twin
crystals are common. Although so excessively
hard the edges of the crystals
as found in the beds of streams are often
rounded from the wear of the other pebbles,
probably chiefly quartz. Only the
wear of centuries could produce such a
result, however, for, as is well known, it
is only with its own dust that the Diamond
can be abraded to any appreciable
degree by any of the means now used for
cutting it.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>One important property of crystallized
Diamond is that of cleavage parallel to
the faces of the octahedron. This cleavage
is of much service in preparing the
gem for cutting, as by taking advantage
of it, broad, flat surfaces can be obtained
without grinding. This property also
distinguishes Diamond from quartz, for
which its crystals as found in sands are
sometimes mistaken. Quartz has no
cleavage. The fracture of the two
minerals is the same, however, being conchoidal.</p>
<p>The massive forms of the Diamond
known as bort and carbonado
possess little or no cleavage, thus
increasing their value as abrasives
and for setting in drills, saws,
etc. The true bort occurs as rounded
forms made up of a confused aggregate
of crystals and is harder than ordinary
Diamond. Fragments of crystals of no
value as gems or any crude Diamond dust
are also known as bort in trade. Carbonado
is a name given to black Diamond
which has more or less crystalline structure.
This graduates into the crystallized
mineral. Either of these is more valuable
than the crystallized Diamond for industrial
purposes, although of no value as
gems.</p>
<p>As already noted, Diamond occurs of
various colors, about half the stones
found being tinged to some degree. If the
color is but slight, the stone is considered
less valuable than if perfectly colorless,
but a Diamond of pronounced color is the
most valuable gem known.</p>
<p>Among colors of Diamonds, blue is the
rarest. The largest and most valuable
colored Diamond known is the Hope
Blue, weighing 44&frac12; carats. This is valued
at about one hundred thousand dollars.
It has a brilliant deep blue color and
is without a flaw. A deep blue Diamond
weighing 67-<sup class="fr">2</sup>/<sub>16</sub> carats was long worn
in the French crown, but it was stolen in
1792 and has never been recovered. Red
Diamonds vary in hue from ruby red to
rose, the latter being the most common.
No large red Diamonds are known, the
largest being one of 32 carats in Vienna.
Another famous one is that in the Russian
treasury, for which Paul I paid one
hundred thousand roubles. It is of a
ruby color. The finest green Diamond
known is the &ldquo;Dresden Green&rdquo; preserved
in the Green Vaults of Saxony. It
was purchased by August the Strong in
1743 for sixty thousand dollars. It is
apple green in color and weighs 40 carats.
Diamonds of yellow color are comparatively
common, many of the Cape
Diamonds being lowered in value by possessing
a yellow tinge. It is said that
this injurious yellow tinge can be overcome
by dipping the stone several times
in a solution of potassium permanganate,
the violet color of the latter neutralizing
the yellow of the Diamond. The yellow
tinge usually also disappears in artificial
light. Of large Diamonds possessing
a yellow color the Florentine and the
Tiffany are the best known. The color
of colored Diamonds is generally permanent,
but that of some is said to fade on
exposure to light. It can also be destroyed
or changed by heat.</p>
<p>The luster of the Diamond is a peculiar
one, and such as is possessed by few
other minerals. In reference to its occurrence
in the Diamond it is known as
the adamantine luster. It combines the
peculiarity of an oily luster with that of
glass and that of a metal. It is doubtless
due to the high refractive power of
the mineral, which causes more than the
ordinary number of rays of light to come
to the eye. In the impure forms of Diamond
the greasy or oily luster becomes
more pronounced. Once the eye becomes
accustomed to the peculiar luster of Diamond
the stone may easily be distinguished
by it from glass or minerals with
a vitreous luster, such as quartz. Certain
other minerals, however, such as cerussite,
zircon, and to some extent sphene,
exhibit the adamantine luster. In the
glass known as strass, used to make imitation
Diamonds, the adamantine luster
is well imitated.</p>
<p>Diamond is usually transparent, but it
may be translucent and even opaque, especially
the black varieties. Even otherwise
transparent Diamond often contains
inclusions which cloud and interrupt its
clearness. These constitute the &ldquo;flaws&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
which so often injure the value of a
Diamond and prevent it from being of
the &ldquo;first water.&rdquo; These inclusions may
be simply small cavities, sometimes so
numerous as to make the stone nearly
black, or they may be particles of other
minerals, such as chlorite, hematite or
carbonaceous matter. If the latter, the
flaws can sometimes be burned out by
careful heating.</p>
<p>As already remarked, the refractive
power of the Diamond is very high. The
rays of light entering it are bent at a high
angle, causing a large degree of what is
called total reflection within the stone.
The effect of this is to light the stone&rsquo;s
interior. Moreover, the rays of light are
concentrated on a smaller part of the
surface than is the case with less highly
refracting minerals and thus also internal
illumination is produced. The most important
result of the high refractive
power of the Diamond is the wide dispersion
of the spectrum, causing the red
rays to be widely separated from the blue
rays and strong lights of one color to be
transmitted to the eye as could not be the
case were the different rays less widely
separated. It is this power of flashing
different colored lights which gives the
Diamond one of its chief charms. The
index of refraction ranges from 2.40 for
the red rays to 2.46 for the violet rays.
Ordinary glass has an index of refraction
for the red rays of only 1.52 and for the
violet 1.54, making the spectrum only
about half as long as that produced by
the Diamond.</p>
<p>Another pleasing property of the Diamond
is the fact that it is usually more
brilliant by artificial light than by natural,
although some individual stones have a
reverse behavior.</p>
<p>Diamond is much the hardest substance
known in Nature, and as the proverb
says only the Diamond is able to &ldquo;cut
Diamond.&rdquo; It is ranked 10 in the scale
of hardness on which minerals are classified,
corundum being the next below it.
It is really separated by a wide gap from
the latter mineral, however, and its hardness
is as much greater than that of
corundum as that of corundum is greater
than that of the first mineral in the scale.
This hardness of Diamond affords a
ready means of identifying it, as it will
scratch all other substances. It is popularly
supposed that Diamond is the only
mineral which will scratch glass to any
extent, and a stone found is often reported
to be Diamond because it will do
this. As a matter of fact, however, all
quartz will scratch glass and the harder
minerals, garnet, topaz, beryl and others
will do so easily. Minerals which will
scratch glass are therefore common. The
Diamond cuts glass instead of scratching
it, and is the only mineral that will do
this. Although the Diamond is so hard,
it is not tough, and can be easily broken
with the blow of a hammer. It was a tradition
of the ancients that if a Diamond
were put upon an anvil and struck with a
hammer, both hammer and anvil would
be shattered without injuring the Diamond
in the least. One occasionally
hears this statement made even at the
present day. It is entirely untrue, however,
the Diamond being as brittle as at
least the average of crystallized minerals.
The specific gravity of the Diamond is
about three and one-half times that of
water, determinations showing variations
between 3.49 and 3.53. Carbonado is
lower, ranging between 3.14 and 3.41.
Diamond is thus a comparatively heavy
mineral, the only ones among the gems
which much exceed it in specific weight
being hyacinth, garnet, ruby, sapphire
and chrysoberyl.</p>
<p>Diamond becomes strongly electric on
friction so that it will pick up pieces of
paper and other light substances. It does
not retain its electricity long, however,
usually not over half an hour. It is not
a conductor of electricity, differing in
this respect from graphite, which is a good
conductor. Diamond becomes phosphorescent
on rubbing with a cloth, giving
out a light which is visible in the dark.
Some stones emit such a light after being
exposed to the sun&rsquo;s rays for a time, as if
they took it up from the sun and gave it
out again. This has often been stated
to be a property of all Diamond, but this
is not true, only certain stones exhibiting
it. As first suggested by Mr. Geo. F.
Kunz, it is probable that this phosphorescence
is due to minute quantities of hydrocarbons
which emit light on being
heated by the friction given the stone.
It is curious to note that the light is in
some cases given out only from certain
crystal faces of the stone. Thus Diamonds
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
are known which give out light
from the cubic faces but not from the
octahedral, while others are reported as
giving out light of different colors from
different faces.</p>
<p>The name Diamond comes from the
Greek adamas, which means unconquerable.
This term was doubtless applied
because of the great resistant power
assigned to it by the ancients. Besides
the well known tradition that it could not
be broken by hammer and anvil, they believed
that it could be subdued or broken
down only when dipped in warm goat&rsquo;s
blood. Our words adamant and adamantine
are also derived from adamas, the
latter term still being used to describe the
luster of the Diamond. The change of
adamas into the word Diamond is
thought by some to have come from prefixing
to it the Italian diafano, transparent,
in allusion to its possessing this property.</p>
<p>According to classical mythology the
Diamond was first formed by Jupiter,
who turned into stone a man known as
Diamond of Crete, for refusing to forget
him after he had ordered all men to
do so. Many medicinal virtues were
ascribed to the Diamond, it being regarded
as an antidote for poisons and a preventive
of mania.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s supply of Diamonds has
come almost wholly from three countries&mdash;India,
Brazil and South Africa. Up
to the beginning of the eighteenth century
India was the only source of Diamonds
known. The Diamond fields
of India occur chiefly in the eastern
and southern portions of the peninsula.
The famed region of Golconda is in the
southern part. This is the territory
whence have come the most celebrated
Indian stones, such as the Kohinoor and
the Hope Blue. The French traveler Tavernier
reported when he was there in
1665, that sixty thousand men were then
employed in these mines. Now the
mines have all been given up and the region
is abandoned.</p>
<p>The present yield of Indian Diamonds
comes almost wholly from mines in a district
south of Allahabad and Benares. The
Diamonds occur here, as universally in
India, in a conglomerate or sandstone
made up of the remains of older rocks.</p>
<p>The mines are worked almost wholly
by natives of the lower caste, attempts of
Europeans to conduct the mining not
having met with success. The natives
separate the Diamonds by washing, or
where the rock is too hard for such methods,
break it up by heating and throwing
cold water upon it. The production of
Diamonds from all of India is at the
present time very small, not reaching a
million dollars a year in value. It is likely
in time to disappear altogether since
most of the old mines have been abandoned
and even their location forgotten
and the returns from the present mines
are not very profitable.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Diamond fields were the
first important ones to become known
after those of India. Diamonds were first
found here in 1729 in river sands which
were being worked for gold by adventurers
who penetrated into the region
from the coast. The gold miners paid no
attention to the bright crystals sometimes
seen in the bottoms of their pans, but a
monk who had seen Diamonds mined
in India recognized them as gems indeed.
While for many years the Diamonds
obtained came wholly from the river sands,
later, upland deposits were discovered
which now afford a part of the supply.
Diamonds have been found in the following
provinces of Brazil: Bahia, Goyaz,
Matto Grosso, Minas Geraes and Parana.
In all except Bahia and Minas Geraes the
mining is desultory and consists simply
in washing river sands by means of
wooden bowls. Enough Diamonds are
thus obtained to afford a precarious living
to the garimperos, as they are called,
who follow this occupation. The chief
Diamond bearing region of Brazil at the
present time is in the province of Minas
Geraes, centered about the city of Diamantina.
The black variety of Diamond
known as carbonado comes chiefly from
the province of Bahia and is in large demand
for industrial purposes. The Brazilian
Diamonds are as a rule small, but
exceed all others in luster. The largest
Brazilian Diamond known is that named
Star of the South, which weighed in the
rough 254.5 carats and was valued at one
hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>As is generally known the chief source
of Diamonds at the present time is South
Africa. As in Brazil, Diamonds were
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
first discovered here in the river sands
and these still afford a small supply.
These were first known in 1867, but in
1871 the deposits in place near Kimberley
were found and these constitute today the
world&rsquo;s great Diamond mines. The
mines now being worked are four in number,
and all occur within an area hardly
three miles square. Geologically the
formation seems to be that of a filling of
old volcanic necks by an influx of mud
from below. It is this mud which now
considerably hardened contains the Diamonds.
The largest Diamonds of the
world have been obtained from these
mines, some exceeding the Kohinoor in
size. Their quality is also generally
good, although sometimes injured by a
yellow tinge.</p>
<p>Besides the above countries, Diamonds
have been found in Australia, the Ural
Mountains, British Guiana and the
United States. The finds have usually
been in the beds of streams and are not of
sufficient abundance to make systematic
mining profitable. The localities where
Diamonds have been found in the State
of Wisconsin, in this country, are on the
terminus of a moraine which came from
the North, somewhere in the region of
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. It is hence not improbable
that the &ldquo;mother lode&rdquo; will some
day be found there.</p>
<p>Finally it is interesting to know that
Diamonds occur in meteorites, and hence
doubtless exist in other worlds than ours.</p>

<h2 id="c17">THE HORNED TOADS.</h2>
<p>The Horned Toads form an interesting
group of Lizards which are related
to the iguanas of the tropical forests of
America. They are, however, terrestrial
lizards, inhabiting the plains of Southwestern
United States and Mexico.
Their short, broad and more or less
flattened bodies, rounded heads and short
tails give these animals quite a striking
resemblance to the common toad. Hence
their common name. In one respect,
however, they are not at all like the toad.
The head is armed behind with a row of
quite formidable horny spines, and in
some of the species shorter ones are also
present on the top of the head and on
various parts of the body. As these lizards
are slow in motion, the horns constitute
one of their chief means of defense.
When in the presence of an enemy
&ldquo;the muzzle is depressed and the
horns are elevated. The back is also
arched.&rdquo; The utility of the horns as a
means of defense has been amply proven.
The dead bodies of snakes have been
found with the horns protruding through
the skin of the body near the head. But
this is not their only means of defense.
From birds they are protected by their
coloration, which is a somber mixture of
brown, black and yellowish, and when
quietly resting on sands or rocks in the
open they quite closely resemble stones
covered with lichens of varying shades
of color. Abundant as they are in some
arid regions of the Southwest, they frequently
escape the notice of the observer
because of their coloration. In such regions,
too, they can take refuge beneath
the protecting spines of the Agaves and
the branches of the prickly Opuntias.
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger considers the
Horned Toads a most striking illustration
of protective mimicry. Of one species
he says: &ldquo;In the cedar and pine
belts of the San Francisco Mountains the
dark color of the soil and stones covering
the surface is closely matched by the
ground color of the Horned Toad, while
the greenish gray and orange-colored
markings which somewhat irregularly
adorn their backs are perfect imitations
of the lichens covering the rocks and pebbles
among which these odd looking creatures
live. Near the rim of the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, on the other
hand, the ground is covered with small
pebbles of variously colored sandstone,
ranging from a clayey white to brick red
and dark brown, and the specimen which
I collected there is such a faithful reproduction
of the surroundings that it would
undoubtedly have remained undetected
had it not been moving. Even more remarkable
are the specimens which Dr.
Merriam collected in the black lava belt.
One of these was brought to camp alive.&rdquo;
Dr. Stejneger made a careful study of
this specimen and found that it had very
closely imitated the color of the lava, including
even its glossy appearance.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable habits of
at least one of the species, and possibly
of all the Horned Toads, is the power of
ejecting jets of blood from the eyes. This
power is rarely exercised and seemingly
only when greatly irritated. Professor
L. M. Underwood relates the following
instance, which also illustrates some of
the other habits of the Horned Toads
when angered: &ldquo;In 1885 a student of
mine received a specimen of Horned Toad
from California. In examining the animal
I took occasion to turn him on his
back, using a lead pencil for the purpose.
The animal resented this treatment and
showed considerable anger, opening his
mouth and puffing up his body. Irritating
the animal still more, he grew more
and more enraged, until finally blood
spurted from just above his eye, which
was fired at least a foot from the animal,
as several spots struck my arm considerably
above my wrist. After spurting
the blood the toad became limp and collapsed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
and remained in a stupor for some
time, and, when handled, behaved as if
dead. After a time, possibly not over
five or six minutes, certainly not over
ten, the animal revived and commenced
to run about the table.&rdquo; Irritating him
again in the same manner, Professor
Underwood caused the toad to go
through the operation a second time,
which was followed, as in the first instance,
by collapse and stupor. &ldquo;No
amount of irritation could produce a
third discharge, although the animal
showed some anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This habit of the Horned Toads has
been observed by a number of scientists
and it is said that the Mexicans have called
them Sacred Toads, &ldquo;because they wept
tears of blood.&rdquo; An examination with
a microscope clearly shows that the ejected
liquid is blood. As to the purpose of
this habit, Dr. O. P. Hay says: &ldquo;It appears
to me quite likely that it is done
in order to defend itself from the attacks
of its enemies, although it would
not seem likely that blood would hurt
the eyes much. Nevertheless a discharge
of blood into the eyes of some persevering
bird or snake might so seriously interfere
with its clearness of vision that
the lizard might make its escape while
the enemy was wiping its eyes.&rdquo; One
investigator, at least, has had the experience
of having the stream of blood enter
his eye. It was followed by pain which
lasted for some time, but was relieved as
soon as the blood was entirely wiped
from the eye. Some inflammation followed,
but soon it disappeared.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other lizards, the
Horned Toads are not provided with a
protrusive tongue. This fact, together
with their clumsy form, prevents them
from preying on the more lively insects.
They chiefly feed upon the beetles and
other slowly moving insects that inhabit
the region in which they live. The food
is captured in the evening, and if undisturbed
the toads remain quite passive
throughout the day. In captivity they
are interesting pets and if they will take
food they bear confinement for a long
time. &ldquo;They not infrequently, however,
starve themselves to death, though their
capacity to live without food is marvelous.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c18">DOWN IN DIXIE-LAND.</h2>
<p>One never has to travel very far from
home to see something new and interesting;
so I wonder if all of the readers
know of the &ldquo;frizzly chicken&rdquo; which is
so popular among the colored people of
our southern states.</p>
<p>It is of ordinary size and like the rest
of the chicken family, except that its
feathers stand on end like the quills of
an angry porcupine. It reminded me
of a chicken perpetually blown before a
March wind. Of course, their feathers
become ragged and &ldquo;frizzled,&rdquo; like the
hair of their proud possessors, and I
imagine the motherly inclined do not
find their sittings quite so comfortable
as do our meek-looking hens.</p>
<p>As a rule, the negroes are very humane
in their treatment of domestic animals.
The dogs are treated as well as the children,
and nearly every cabin door has a
hole cut in it for the entrance and exit
of the family cats. As the weather is
seldom cold, these ventilators are really
good for the larger inmates.</p>

<h2 id="c19">MY BAT.</h2>
<p>When I discovered the bat he was
hanging by his hind feet, head downward
between the blind and the window.
I could not see him breathe and thought
he must be dead, but he was only sleeping.</p>
<p>We closed the shutters of the blind as
softly as we could, but it awoke him, and
he began to wiggle and twist. He could
not get away and we lowered the window
from the top and grabbed the little
fellow.</p>
<p>How he did scold and snap his jaws
together! His little teeth were sharp
and he tried his best to bite us.</p>
<p>We put him in a box and put a piece
of coarse wire netting over the top.</p>
<p>Mr. Bat did not enjoy being made a
prisoner, and did not quiet down until
he found he could hang head downward
from the netting.</p>
<p>He was quite a pretty little animal,
his body being about two inches long,
with soft, thick, reddish brown fur on
its upper and under part and on his
head. His eyes were small and dark,
and his head looked like a tiny bear&rsquo;s,
but there was no hair on his ears.</p>
<p>His wings also were without hair and
nearly black in color. When hanging by
his hind legs he kept his wings folded
tightly against his body.</p>
<p>The bat&rsquo;s hind feet were very small,
having five tiny toes with the smallest
possible nails. By having one toe around
the wire of the netting he could hold
himself suspended in the air.</p>
<p>The little fellow&rsquo;s mode of walking
on the bottom of the box was very awkward.
He would thrust forth the claw
at the end of one of his wings and hook
it into the box, then advance the hind
foot and tumble forward, repeating the
process with the opposite side, thus tumbling
and staggering along, falling first
to one side, then to the other.</p>
<p>If he wanted to hang from the netting
he would reach up a hind foot and
gain a foothold in the side of the box,
then raise the other, thus climbing backwards
until he could clasp the netting.</p>
<p>In the evening the bat got out of the
box and was flying about the room before
we knew he had escaped. He flew
round and round in a circle, sometimes
striking the walls of the room. His
wings made considerable noise and he
looked many times larger when flying.</p>
<p>We thought we should have to shut
him up in the room until morning, but
at last succeeded in catching him by hitting
and knocking him to the floor with
a coat, then throwing it over him.</p>
<p>The little fellow struggled and tried
his best to get away, but it was no use.
We put him back into the box and put a
weight on the netting. He scratched
around in the box and scolded all the
evening, but he did not get away again.</p>
<p>The next morning I thought he would
be hungry and tried to get him to eat
and drink. He lapped a little water and
a little milk out of a teaspoon, running
out his tiny red tongue and making a little
hacking noise.</p>
<p>He would not be tempted to eat a fly,
shaking his head and spitting the flies
out as fast as I could put them into his
mouth.</p>
<p>As he would not eat we thought the
little fellow would starve if I did not let
him go. I waited until evening and took
the box outdoors. He was hanging to
the netting, and I took it off and turned
it over so he could fly. He spread out
his wings and away he went, glad to be
at liberty once more.</p>
<p>I have looked every morning to see if
the bat is hanging against the window,
but have not seen him since I set him
free.</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE ATLAS MOTH.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Attacus atlas</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>India is not only noted for its large
and ferocious beasts, but also for its
gorgeous flowers and beautiful insects.
Among these is the splendid Atlas Moth,
noted not alone for the extravagance
of its coloring, but also for its immense
size, for it is the giant of the moths and
butterflies. The largest specimen recorded
is now in the British Museum.
Expanded and measured from tip to tip
of the fore wings, it is only one-quarter
of inch less than one foot. Measured in
the same manner, the specimen of our illustration
is a trifle over ten inches. The
average expansion, however, is only about
eight or nine inches. Its large size influenced
Linnaeus to give this moth the
specific designation of Atlas, the name
of one of the Greek gods, by whom the
pillars of heaven were supposed to be
supported. In later years the word has
been used in a figurative sense indicative
of an ability to sustain a great burden.
Truly no other name would be more appropriate,
for the large wings of the
Atlas Moth enable it to fly swiftly and to
long distances, though its flight is somewhat
erratic.</p>
<p>The larvae or caterpillars of this regal
moth are fully as interesting and beautiful
as the adult insect. They have a long,
thick and fleshy body, which bears several
rows of tubercles, crowned with spiny
hairs. When young they are black with
white spines, but afterwards become a
rich green color and bear bluish-green or
black spines. It is said that the larvae
eat their skins after moulting and it has
been suggested that the object of this
habit is to prevent the cast off skins from
indicating their presence to birds and
other enemies.</p>
<p>The Atlas Moth varies considerably in
the color of its wings and, when compared
with the expanse of its wings, its
body is very short. A peculiar and striking
characteristic is the large and triangular
transparent spot near the center
of each of the four wings.</p>
<p>Among its allies are some of the most
important of the silk producing moths
of India, China and Japan, and the common
emperor moth of England. Other
species of the genus Attacus inhabit Central
and South America, but they are
much smaller and not as beautiful as
the Atlas.</p>

<h2 id="c22">WHEN BILLIE CAME BACK.</h2>
<p>Billie is the handsomest Flicker that
comes to the grove of oaks on the north
campus of the college and that is saying
a great deal. For several years he
has occupied a splendid house hollowed
out with much labor in the great oak by
the power house. Just above the portico
of his house Billie has his xylophone.
This remarkable instrument is just seasoned
enough and has just the correct
spring in its splinters. Here every
morning, at this season, he beats a series
of tunes, monotonous perhaps, but rather
pleasing to Billie and me. After beating
a tune, he screams at the top of his
voice, &ldquo;Get up; get up.&rdquo; He is an alarm
clock and a great nuisance to those who
love their morning nap, but I would not
allow him to be disturbed, he seems so
business-like and earnest. My wife
was disposed to disparage his musical
attainments, but when she saw the marvelous
rapidity of his strokes and the
beauty of his red crest flashing in the
slanting sunlight she became a partisan.</p>
<p>It should be said, of course, that after
the brief season of courtship is over and
Billie&rsquo;s wife is busy about her housekeeping,
he is less musical and we do
not have our reveille so regularly.</p>
<p>Early last spring a pair of English
sparrows took possession of Billie&rsquo;s house
and worked with a diligence worthy a
better cause to fill it with sticks and bits
of straw. I was interested at once and
waited eagerly to see what Billie would
do when he should return. I did not
have many days to wait. One fine day
I heard Billie hammering a gay tune.
I watched and was soon rewarded. Billie
seemed taken aback, but soon recovered
from his surprise and proceeded to clean
house at a great rate. Meantime the
sparrows could do nothing but scold, and
I confess to a degree of satisfaction in
their discomfiture. For once the speckled
little Ishmaelites were impotent.</p>
<p>Finally the last straw was thrown out
and Billie perched upon the limb that
served as a portico for his house,
screamed with defiance and satisfaction.
Soon he flew to a distant part of the
grove in search of the future Mrs.
Flicker, I suppose, and was gone for
perhaps an hour. The sparrows worked
desperately and had nearly all of the material
replaced when Billie, disappointed
in his quest and in no very good humor,
returned. This time Billie&rsquo;s patience
was entirely gone and he threw sticks
right and left, stopping occasionally to
scream with anger. He seemed to know
there would be little use in chasing the
pesky sparrows. He did not go far from
home after that, so that the sparrows
were compelled to go house hunting
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Billie mounted guard over his fireside
and his altars for several days, treating
us to a quantity if not a variety of
drum solos, and the seductive notes of
his cross cut saw of a voice were in constant
evidence. He never knew the sorrow
of the human performer of like
merit when his best friends are willing
for him to rest.</p>
<p>One fine day a demure looking female,
attracted by his music, came and critically
examined the house. I knew she
was already won, but Billie did not, and
it was amusing to watch his antics. Did
you ever see a Flicker desperately in
love? It was evidently love at first
sight with Billie. He spread his wings,
showed the jet black crescent on his
vest, displayed the crimson glory of his
crest, played his most catchy tune on
the xylophone and sang his most melodious
song. Meantime the coy female, already
decided, still appeared to be unable
to make up her mind. She made as if to
go on, and Billie was in despair, and redoubled
his persuasion. She had never
heard such a tattoo, nor seen such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
xylophone, nor yet so fine a fellow as
Billie. Soon she stopped her pretended
search for larvae under the loose bark
and made another inspection of the
house. She exemplified the maxim, &ldquo;To
hesitate is to be lost,&rdquo; and soon she and
Billie were busy with their housekeeping.
The sparrows got no further
chance to occupy Billie&rsquo;s summer home.
A happy family was reared and educated
and in the autumn disappeared.</p>
<p>As I write Billie has returned and is
beating a merry tune, while six or more
sparrows sit around listening as if to
learn how. Mrs. Flicker has not yet returned,
but I believe the sparrows have
given up the idea of taking his house. I
am in doubt about Mrs. Flicker, but I
know Billie. He is larger and handsomer
than ever. I have studied his
every beautiful feather. Sometimes I
think he jumps behind a limb just to
tease me, but I am fond of him and I
hope he may return for many years.</p>

<h2 id="c23">BEAUTIFUL VINES TO BE FOUND IN OUR WILD WOODS.
<br /><span class="small">II.</span></h2>
<p>A vine of great beauty in our autumn
woods, with its great masses of scarlet
berries, is the Celastrus scandens&mdash;Climbing
Bittersweet or Wax-work.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Celastraceae&mdash;Staff
tree family&mdash;to which family
belongs the wahoo or burning-bush,
with which we are all familiar, from
seeing its abundant red berries in the
autumn woods and in the parks.</p>
<p>The flowers of the Celastrus or Bittersweet
are small, greenish and regular,
growing in clusters at the end of the
branchlets, the staminate and pistillate
forms usually on separate plants, which
accounts for the fact that we often see a
beautiful vine that has bloomed profusely
bearing no flowers; the flowers have
five distinct spreading petals, inserted
with the alternate stamens on the edge
of the disk that lines the base of the
calyx. Its five united sepals form a
cup-shaped calyx. It has five stamens,
one thick style and a three-celled ovary,
with three to six seeds. It can be found
in full blossom about the first of June.</p>
<p>The leaves of the Bittersweet are
from two to three and a half inches in
length, simple alternate, slightly fine-toothed,
and are found from egg shaped
and oblong to the reversed of egg
shaped, the apex always pointed, while
the base is sometimes pointed and sometimes
rounded. The fruit of the Bittersweet
is about one-third of an inch in
diameter, round and a deep orange
color, three-celled with two seeds in
each cell; when it is ripe, it opens into
three parts, showing six bright scarlet
berries within.</p>
<p>The Celastrus is a strong, woody
climber, twining upon itself in coils and
swirls, over fences and walls and bushes
to great distances, often to the top of
immensely high trees.</p>
<p>It is immensely showy and beautiful
in the very late fall when its leaves are
all fallen off and its woody branches are
left thickly studded with its orange and
scarlet fruit. I remember especially one
Christmas eve, in Kentucky, that we
gathered great bunches of it; we found
it growing over an old stone ruin in
great masses and gathering it, with large
bunches of mistletoe, it made ideal decorations
for our Christmas festivities.</p>

<h2 id="c24">COMPTIE.</h2>
<p>When winter, with its blasting, icy
hand, has touched every green thing exposed
to its wantonness, and Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s and
other feast days call loudly for the festive
greenery with which to adorn churches,
halls and dwellings, longing eyes are
turned towards the Southland, where
King Winter&rsquo;s scepter is unknown and
green things flourish the year around.</p>
<p>A walk through the dark hummuck
woods&mdash;so dark that owls overhead hoot
at one in the daytime&mdash;holds the naturalist
and the florist spell-bound.</p>
<p>The numerous varieties of chirping
and twittering birds, the many-hued
spiders, lizards, bugs and beetles, and,
yes, the wriggling snakes, with now and
then the sounds of snarling &rsquo;coons or
&rsquo;possums, the scream of a wild-cat, or the
dashing by of the deer suddenly aroused
from his noon siesta&mdash;all this makes the
naturalist feel as though he had entered
into an enchanted land; but he who loves
&ldquo;the green things growing&rdquo; more than the
things flying, creeping or snarling will
feast his eyes on the ever varying verdure.</p>
<p>Tall palmettos, wide-spreading oaks,
orchids, trailing vines and festooning
mosses sweeping the greener mosses beneath,
ferns, lilies!&mdash;but, &rsquo;twould fill a
volume to enumerate the many beauties
which meet the eye at even a single
glance, each plant and flower in itself
being worthy of a chapter.</p>
<p>There is one plant which especially attracts
our attention and admiration; and
this plant is one of the prettiest and most
useful of the greeneries used for decorations
in the far north in winter. It is
called, variously, &ldquo;Comptie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coontie,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Starch-root,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indian-bread.&rdquo; The
two latter names are due to its large,
bulbous root, which, when grated, makes
a good starch, and which was also
made, by the primitive Indians, into ash-cake,
or bread&mdash;as Indians knew bread.</p>
<p>It is fern-like; but, unlike most ferns, it
is of a sturdy, independent growth, bearing
handling as well as cedar, yet with all
the graceful pliancy of the more tender
ferns. Its stems grow two or three
feet long; the fronds on each side of the
stem being three or four inches in length,
and of a glossy dark green color. From
one to two dozen such stems put out from
a single stalk, growing up into the most
graceful curves.</p>
<p>Seeds, deep crimson in color, and of
the size of a chestnut, form in the center
of the plant, and so compactly as to present
one continuous bulbous form, the
size and shape of a round quart bottle
with part of its neck broken off. This
crimson seed-form, surrounded by the
dark green foliage, is, of itself, a pretty
curiosity, more novel than a flower.</p>
<p>The reason why it is especially valued
for decorations is, because it can be had
at all seasons of the year, and retains its
verdure for several weeks, even after
it has been shipped long distances. Many
of these plants, cut close to the ground,
have been shipped from Florida to Canada,
and have retained their fresh, glossy
appearance for two months. Even without
placing the stems in water, using
them for motto work, they will last two
or three weeks.</p>
<p>And this is but one of Florida&rsquo;s novelties
in plant life.</p>

<h2 id="c26">EGG PLANT.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Solanum esculentum</i> L.)</span></h2>
<p>The Egg-plant, also known as bringal,
aubergine, egg-apple and mad-apple, is
an herbaceous plant belonging to the
Nightshade family (Solanan&aelig;), therefore
kin to the potato and tomato. It is a
tender annual, readily killed by the early
frosts. It has rather large, simple, somewhat
incised leaves. The fruits are large,
egg-shaped, tomato-like in structure,
hence berries.</p>
<p>It is quite extensively cultivated in
gardens. The seeds are sown in hot beds
early in April but transplanting is not
done until about the first of June, when
all danger of frost is past. The soil
should be very rich and the plants set
about three feet apart. Like most transplanted
plants they require shading and
watering for a few days. Careful cultivation
is required during the entire season.
Propping may be necessary to keep
the large, heavy fruits from the ground.
The Colorado beetle is a very annoying
enemy of the growing plants and must be
effectually fought to insure a crop.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of Egg-plant.
The purple variety is by long
odds the greatest favorite. There are
also white and yellow varieties.</p>
<p>Most people consider the properly prepared
fruit of the Egg-plant a delicacy.
In some tropical countries it forms an important
article of diet. The ripe fruit is
prepared for the table by peeling and boiling.
After boiling the fruit is sliced, seasoned
and fried until well browned, in
rolled crackers or bread crusts and a liberal
supply of butter. When well prepared
it is a very palatable article of diet
but when insufficiently cooked or fried it
is indigestible. It does not seem to be
prepared in other ways nor does it seem
to have any noteworthy medicinal properties.</p>
